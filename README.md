# Lunar Tower of Hanoi
A space-themed version of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem. The project is created for a demonstration at a K-12 robotics event, but the storyline can transfer to many settings.  

## Story Line
You are a programmer and crane operator working for NASA in the year 2040. NASA has a small colony on the moon. They also have a large unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on the moon.  NASA wants to move certain habitats to a statistically safer location. The habitats are modular and the UAV can pick up one module at a time. You are tasked with moving the habitats autonomously with the UAV. In order to protect the modules you cannot place them directly on the surface of the moon. NASA has built two new foundations for you to use in moving. There is the current foundation, a middle foundation, and a destination foundation. The first habitat you need to move is three modules high.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Scratch, C

This project is part of an outreach event planned for the NASA SUITS competition for team JARVIS of the Space Earth Anologs Research Chapter (SEARCH) of Purdue. The audience will consist of students competing in the Indiana State Vex Robotics Tournament. In order to provide a familiar programming environment of what is used by the students the challenge will be in Scratch and C. The elementary and middle school levels use a block-based editor and the High (and some middle) school level uses C++. The Tower of Hanoi problem was chosen because it can be as complicated or as simple as the student wants it to be.  We will provide the user-defined functions needed to move "disk" and have the students design a function that moves them in the correct order. All of the elementary and middle school students will probably choose to hardcode the problem. Some high school teams use complex position-tracking algorithms and might find the recursive solution, and if there is a student who is secretly a professional programmer they might remove tail recursion.

## Learning Outcomes

Depending on the current level of the programmer there are different skills this problem will teach/refine. If they are new to programming this would teach them the critical thinking needed to be a successful programmer.  If they know user-defined functions this could be used to introduce recursion. If they are learning about optimization techniques this could be used to show tail recursion removal. Furthermore, if they are learning about data structures this can be used to practice having a stack remove recursion. There are probably many other lessons too.  The Tower of Hanoi is an important problem to revisit as you learn more about programming.
